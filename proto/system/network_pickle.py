# The idea for this program is
# 1. Create complex class
#   - some of data will be pickled, some is local
# 2. Generate pickled data locally
#   - make sure that data not to be pickled is not pickled
# 3. Send it over PodSixNet
# 4. Depickle it abroad
# 5. Make sure the re-init for the non-pickled data was okay
