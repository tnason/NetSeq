Notes
-----
1. MusicPlayer will have to reload beats whenever 'play' is pressed, based on
    the currently-selected page, and whether the play-all flag is set. Perhaps
    best to put these into flags in the MusicPlayer, and let the MusicPlayer
    use this data when playing to set the beats to play
